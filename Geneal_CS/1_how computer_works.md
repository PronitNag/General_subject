## **And the Operating System (OS) manages these hardward**
The **Operating System (OS)** manages all hardware and acts as a bridge between hardware and software.  

### **Key Functions of an OS in Hardware Management:**
1. **Processor Management** – Assigns tasks to the CPU and handles multitasking.
2. **Memory Management** – Allocates RAM to different programs and frees it when not needed.
3. **Storage Management** – Controls file systems and manages data storage.
4. **Device Management** – Uses **device drivers** to communicate with hardware.
5. **Security & Access Control** – Manages user permissions and security.
